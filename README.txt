//==Drawing App==//
//===============//

This app is intended as a practice project for myself.

4th March 2014:
- User can change colours with number keys. Currently only five colours.
- User can draw with the mouse but fast movements currently result in gappy lines.
- User can adjust brush size with the slider. Slider goes from 1 to 50 with steps of 1.
